# Poker-Program
Introducing a poker program that accurately predicts the statistical probabilities of winning a poker hand. 
The program requires the pygame library to be installed. To run the program, run main.py in terminal.  
main.py offers two modes: terminal mode and sunset poker mode. The sunset poker GUI is a more 
user-friendly version of the terminal mode and features a graphical display that enables you to check your winning 
probabilities in any given instance as long as you have two cards and other opponents also have two cards.

In the GUI mode, you are prompted to add players before the game begins. Once you have two or more players, click on
"begin game." Once the game starts, you can choose to either give the opponents hidden face-down cards or select their 
cards yourself. You can also select your own cards. After all players have their cards, you can click on the "calculate probability"
button in any given instance until the round ends (the ends when all cards are on the board and all opponent cards are revealed). 
Additionally, you can reveal opponents' cards at any time if their cards are hidden.

Overall, this poker program is an excellent tool that offers accurate probabilities for winning hands. 
This program requires pygame to be installed and is compatible with python version 3.x
